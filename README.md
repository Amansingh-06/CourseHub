# CourseHub

## Description

CourseHub is a responsive and interactive web application where users can explore a variety of course cards. Each course card has a like/dislike feature powered by Toastify, and users can filter courses based on specific categories using five different filter buttons. The project also includes a loading spinner that appears while the course cards are loading.
